# Getting started

A mobile app to geolocalize abandoned trash and foster community cleanups.

This project was bootstrapped with Expo, and it uses Firebase as a backend. You can add your Firebase credentials to this project by creating in the root folder a `./firebase.ts` file exporting your `firebaseConfig`, and a `./secrets.ts` file exporting your `FIREBASE_API_KEY` and `FIREBASE_URI`.
Then run:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

Also, update name, slug, `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` in the `./app.json` file.
